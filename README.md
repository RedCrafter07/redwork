# redwork

The Svelte framework used by RedCrafter07.
It is quite different to the other frameworks, as redwork utilizes a central router managing all the different routes, which is also customizable.

## Used tech

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) - very fast JavaScript/TypeScript runtime
- [H3](https://h3.unjs.io/) - the server-side router
- [Vite](https://vite.dev) - the frontend build tool
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) - the frontend framework

## Customization

- [ ] Custom routing syntax
- [ ] Full H3/Express plugin support (provided by H3)
- [ ] Use the built-in router, or make your own H3 instance - choice is yours!
